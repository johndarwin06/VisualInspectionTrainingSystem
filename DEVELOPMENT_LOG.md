### Secure Configuration

- Removed MySQL connection details from `App.config`.
- Added workstation-local database settings loading through `DatabaseSettings.local.config`.
- Added `DatabaseSettings.example.config` with placeholder values only.
- Updated `MySqlService` to build the MySQL connection string through `ConfigurationService`.
- Kept the existing repository and service APIs unchanged.
- Added a clear missing or invalid configuration error that does not include the database password.
- Added explicit ignore coverage for `DatabaseSettings.local.config`.
- Added local setup instructions to `README.md`.
- Built `VisualInpsectionTrainingSystem.slnx` in Debug.
- Final build succeeded with 0 errors and 1 warning.
- Verified missing local configuration handling with a temporary probe.
- Verified invalid local configuration handling with a temporary probe.
- Launched the WPF application from the Debug build output and stopped it after startup validation.
- Full valid-credential login validation was blocked because no accepted local MySQL password is available in this shell.
- Sanitized Git history check found older `App.config` commits containing a redacted `Pwd=` value; history was not rewritten automatically.
